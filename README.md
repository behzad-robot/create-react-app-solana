# ðŸ˜Š Do this without cloning this repo? 
The proccess is atually quite simple if you want to do it with your own create-react-app project:

    npm run eject

Then add these items to resolve section of your webpack.config.js:

    resolve:{
        // This allows you to set a fallback for where webpack should look for modules.
        fallback: {
            assert: require.resolve('assert'),
            buffer: require.resolve('buffer'),
            crypto: require.resolve('crypto-browserify'),
            stream: require.resolve('stream-browserify'),
        },
        //..... blah blah other config things
    },
    ignoreWarnings: [/Failed to parse source map/],
